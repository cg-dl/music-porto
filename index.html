                    C. G. Davin Leonardo is an amateur composer of Classical music and Sacred Music, focusing on choral composition. He started writing music when he was 14. He also learned piano and violin by self-taught. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Davin loves Classical music since he was 11. His love for Classical music motivated him to learn piano at 11 and violin at 14. But since then, he found enjoyment when he wrote simple instrumental music (mostly unpublished waltzes). 
                    <br/><br/>
                    During his high school years, Davin also found himself fond of singing Classical arias and participated in his school choir. Currently, he goes to a university in Jakarta and become a member of the university choir. He learns more about choir and singing. He sings at Baritone range. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    His composition styles are influenced by Classical and Renaissance composers, with some of his own touches. Davin likes to compose music "that sounds beautiful and complex but accessible by most". He also creates some arrangements of old hymns and Church music.
